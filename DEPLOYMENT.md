## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Test the deployment**: Visit your deployed URL and test login
2. **Verify Oso Cloud integration**: Check that authorization is working
3. **Test all user roles**: Login as CEO, Manager, and Employee
4. **Test time-off requests**: Submit and approve requests
5. **Monitor logs**: Check for any errors in the platform's logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')"**
- This means `OSO_AUTH_API_KEY` is not set
- Add the environment variable to your deployment platform

**"Database not found"**
- The SQLite database is created automatically on first run
- Make sure the app has write permissions

**"Authorization failed"**
- Check that your Oso Cloud API key is correct
- Verify that policies are uploaded to Oso Cloud
- Check that user facts are synced

### Getting Help

- Check the platform's documentation
- Look at the deployment logs
- Test locally first to isolate issues
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, unique secrets for production
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor your application logs for suspicious activity
